This app was developed during a college competition involving 7 teams, my team's project was amongst the best ones. Haver & Boecker Niagara requested the development of an app to enhance their Non-Conformance Reporting (NCR) system, which was previously managed through an outdated and user-unfriendly method. The app was built on ASP.NET and is fully responsive.
